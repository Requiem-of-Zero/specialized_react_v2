This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Specialized Clone
This is a clone of [Specialized](https://www.specialized.com/us/en) created with Contentful CMS and NextJS/React stack. Utility libraries used for organization was Styled-Components and Storybook for component documentation.

This project was my own individual test of taking on a challenge of learning new technologies by myself I wasn't familiar with in order to gain even more understanding of the full-stack development cycle.

```zsh
npm install
# then
npm run dev
# or
yarn install
#then
yarn dev
```
